# Conway's game of life
On a lazy Thursday afternoon I did my try on the Game Of Life.

The cells are stored as the keys of a Python dictionary. They are drawn as black squares on a white background, waiting half a second between generations.

The default image is 400x400 pixels. It can be modified in the first line of the draw() function.

The initial condition can be set in the body of the script. Some cool basic patterns are already specified.

Cells can reproduce infinetly, but only the ones within the coordinates of the image will show.
