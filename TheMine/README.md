# The Mine

The Mine is a game I played when I was a child, but revisiting it now made me realize how repetitive the levels were. I decided to make something about it. 

All the drawings are mine, back from the days I had to draw with the mouse. 

(I'm aware of the bugs in the multiplayer mode, consider them features).

Feel free to download it and play, and tell me about it! Please tell people about me if you talk about the game.

## How to play
You are a robot miner. Press down key to release the rope in the appropriate angle and extract precious things from the mine.

The goal is to acumulate enough money to get to the next level. The reamining time and the goal money appear at the top of the screen.

Between levels you can access the shop, where you can buy powerups for the next level for a price.

Each level is unique and it is generated at runtime with a heuristic function that assigns a probability of objects to spawn accordingly to what it has spawned already. So valuabe diamonds call other diamonds, but also priceless heavy rocks.

Are you lucky enough to get a worm carrying a gem?
