Games for pc and mobile devices.

The Mine is a game I played when I was a child, but revisiting it now made me realize how repetitive the levels were. I decided to make something about it. All the drawings are mine, so they may not look entirely proffesional. (I'm aware of the bugs in the multiplayer mode, consider them a feature).
Feel free to download it and play, and tell me about it! Please tell people about me if you talk about the game.
The goal is to acumulate enough money to get to the next level. Are you spending something at the shop to improve, or are you more of the save-all style?
